------------------------------------

INSTALLATION 
************************************
1. Unzip the folder "cricketstats" to yoursite/modules/  folder  on your server.
2. Install the module as you usually do.
3. Go to the modules admin and set the preferences from the module menu
4. Now you are ready to go!!!

LOGGING IN FOR THE FIRST TIME
************************************
-Make sure you have setup the season and league, teams are unique to each season and also unique to each league too.
-You must first add at least two teams per League to the database to access leaguamatches-page.

MENU AND SEASON SELECTOR
************************************
With menu you can navigate through admin area and with season/league selector 
you can change season/league you want to edit.

SEASON CONTROL
************************************
You can add as many seasons as you like, though seasons with 
same name can not be added. Add new season simply by giving a 
season name and clicking 'Add season'-button. New season name should 
now appear on the right side of the page.

It is best to use years as season names ie.  2004, 2005, 2006 and so on.
But you can enter any name you want for the season.

Modify season by clicking it first from the list and then do necessary changes.
Seasons are automatically published. If you don't want to publish specific 
season, then uncheck the checkbox. If season is published, it is visible 
at the actual statistics.

If you want to delete a season, you must first delete all matches from it.

LEAGUE CONTROL
************************************
You can add as many leagues as you like, though leagues with 
same name can not be added. Add new league simply by giving a 
league name and clicking 'Add league'-button. New league name should 
now appear on the right side of the page.

Modify league by clicking it first from the list and then do necessary changes.
Leagues are automatically published. If you don't want to publish specific 
league, then uncheck the checkbox. If league is published, it is visible 
at the actual statistics.

If you want to delete a league, you must first delete all matches from it.

leagues are NOT unique to each season, so all league names can be seen in any season.

TEAM CONTROL
*************************************
Control teams same as seasons and leagues. There is a checkbox when you edit a team name.
If checkbox is checked, it means that team is your team.

Teams are unique to each season and league,
you will only see the teams that are entered for the selected season & league.

MAKE SURE that you select the correct league and season before submitting a new team!!


 LEAGUE MATCH CONTROL
*************************************

Add matches:
-choose a date (year is automatically chosen from the year name or season name
so make sure the season is in format yyyy eg. 2005
-select teams from the dropdown menus (add final scores). Finally click
'Add matches'
-max 15 matches can be added to certain date each time
-NOTICE: there can't be duplication entry for a team for one date!!

After selecting Teams matches, enter the amount of runs in the RH column (or RA for away team),
the WH & WA columns are for wickets scored.  ie.. if you scored 145 for 10 you enter 10 in the corresponding column.
the BP column is for Bonus Points, many leagues have different rules concerning bonus points,
these can range from 1 point for reaching 75 runs, 3 points for reaching 100 runs etc.
I thought it best and easier to just add the box for manual input of bonus points instead of trying to figure an automatic based method.


Modify matches:
-to choose all matches from certain date, click the date in the left
-to choose single match, click home or away team

Delete match:
-click the home or away team in the left and choose 'delete'

MINITABLE BLOCK
**********************************
TPLLeagueStats comes with a block
showing the default season's/Leagues ranking + runs for and against.
It can be activated via blocks administration.

TIPS
*********************************
If you want to give your team name another color
instead of the default one,
name you team for example <font color="#red">Your team</font>.
This is not comfortable if you want to edit your team's name later 'cause there is 
an issue with it that i hope to solve soon.


TO-DO List:

1) make templatable!
2) admin area improvements & tidy up.
3) make printer friendly page for user front-side (would be easier once templates and smarty enabled)

there maybe a few small issues i haven't found, but am not receiving any php errors or mysql errors.

I have only tested with XOOPS 2.0.13.1.

This module will likely not work with XOOPS 2.2 or higher as it stands at the moment..
If anyone is interested in helping me to achieve the goals on the TODO list and make 2.2 compatible
Your Help will be much apreciated!!


(This module is based on XOOPS tplleaguestats module by mithrandir & Ralf57
 But has been highly modified and improved somewhat to work for cricket teams instead
 of Soccer Teams)
